# Personal website

This repository uses the R blogdown package to construct the website framework, and the website is hosted from GitHub. See an (outdated) description of the workflow provided [here](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/). 

This website utilizes the Hugo Academic template (see below)

## [Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic)

The Hugo **Academic Resumé Template** empowers you to easily create your job-winning online resumé, showcase your academic publications, and create online courses or knowledge bases to grow your audience.

The integrated [**Wowchemy**](https://wowchemy.com) website builder and CMS makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free. Edit your site in the CMS (or your favorite editor), generate it with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and deploy with GitHub or Netlify. Customize anything on your site with widgets, light/dark themes, and language packs.
