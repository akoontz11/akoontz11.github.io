title: Genetic Diversity Indicators
summary: Along with an international team of conservation and population geneticists, I've helped develop and calculate genetic diversity indicators--metrics that serve as proxies for the genetic status of a species and which can be determined with or without genetic data. These indicators are included in the Center for Biological Diversity's [Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity framework](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/). I recently coauthored a [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.14461) outlining the calculation of these indicators for nine different countries, and am currently working on calculating indicator values for [North American trees](https://vimeo.com/982131156).
