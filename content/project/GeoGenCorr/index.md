title: Geographic Genetic Correlation 
summary: Botanic gardens and arboreta strive to protect not just species diversity, but the genetic diversity within those species. In order for genetic diversity to be conserved _ex situ_, wild individuals need to be sampled and genotyped fairly intensely, which can be time-consuming and expensive. This project seeks to understand how well a strong geographic representation of a species is predictive of a thorough genetic representation. This project builds off of [gap analysis approaches](https://mortonarb.org/plant-and-protect/global-tree-conservation/gap-analysis-materials/) used to assess how _ex situ_ conservation can be improved.
