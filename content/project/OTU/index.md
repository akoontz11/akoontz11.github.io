title: Informing OTU thresholds through phylogenetics
summary: Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are used to group similar microbial taxa together based on DNA sequence similarity, but ambiguity over the value used to determine OTU boundaries persists. This research looks to inform OTU thresholds by using a family of phylogenetic branch length transformations, Pagelâ€™s transformations, and to guide species delimitation by examining the impact different thresholds have on community diversity. This research was guided by Dr. William D. Pearse and the [Pearse Lab](http://pearselab.com/).
