title: Ex situ conservation of oaks using RADseq vs. microsatellite markers
summary: Myself and others the [Hoban Lab](https://www.hobanlab.com/) conducted a comparison of SNP and microsatellite markers from 2 rare oaks (_Quercus acerifolia_ and _Q. boyntonii_) to examine how using each impacts _ex situ_ conservation metrics. The paper can be found [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.13650)! This work is part of the larger [Global Conservation Consortium of Oaks](https://globaltrees.org/projects/global-oak-conservation-partnership/), and was funded by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/).
