title: Primula cusickiana species complex analysis
summary: The four members of the _Primula cusickiana_ species complex were each historically classified as their own species, before a 2001 review subsumed them to varieties of the same species (due to largely similar morphologies). I used RADseeq to examine the genetic separation between these varieties, and to verify past findings of large genetic distance between proximate populations of variety _maguirei_, the complex member found in Logan Canyon. This research was guided by [Dr. Paul Wolf](https://paulwolflab.com/) and [Dr. Will Pearse](http://pearselab.com/), and has been published in [Systematic Botany](https://bioone.org/journals/systematic-botany/volume-47/issue-3/036364422X16573019348175/Pronounced-Genetic-Separation-among-Varieties-of-the-Primula-cusickiana-Species/10.1600/036364422X16573019348175.short).
