title: Primula cusickiana species complex analysis
summary: The four members of the _Primula cusickiana_ species complex were each historically classified as their own species, before a 2001 review subsumed them to varieties of the same species (due to largely similar morphologies). Previous research has demonstrated a substantial degree of genetic difference between populations of _Primula cusickiana_ var. _maguirei_, the complex member found in Logan Canyon. My work aims to genomically compare these complex members through GBS techniques, and place the population structure of _P. cusickiana_ var. _maguirei_ into a wider context. This work was guided by Dr. Paul Wolf as part of the [Wolf Lab](https://paulwolflab.com/), and a preprint can be accessed [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.19.436082v1).
